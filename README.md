# letsgoeat
 
## Overview
LetsGoEat is an app that allows users to decide on a place to eat based on the best matches to their input criteria concerning cuisine type, price range and location. More spontaneous users can choose to view a randomly-selected match, but there will also be an option to view a list of all matches. That table of all matching restaurants will be able to be sorted based on each column. Users can "favorite" restaurants in the database and access their list of favorites in their profile.

## Features
- User login: users will be able to create and view a profile, where their favorite restaurants will be saved. Logging out will proteect their data.
- Input form: on the front end, users will fill out a form of their restaurant criteria. The back end of the form will take their input and display only restaurants that match all criteria.
- Database front end: users will be able to view and sort restaurants in tables. They'll also be able to view individual pages for each restaurant, which will include all of the information front the database for that particular restaurant.
- Favorites: users will be able to mark restaurants as favorites, then view that list on their profile.


## Biggest Challenge
For this project, I'll have to learn how to work with existing data from an API and combine it with user-entered data, ultimately storing all of it in one database. I'll also have to learn how to leverage a user's location to output relevant results.
